This week's assignment was to build a web page using user parameters and data from an api call. I chose to use the beer api from BreweryDB at http://www.brewerydb.com/developers
With the examples from class the js, html, and css set up was fairly straightforward. Going through the BreweryDB google hangout helped me figure out how to structure the GET requests - it wasn't clear to me from the documentaiton how to include the key along with the search parameters. I went back to an earlier class to figure out how to get the input text data using jquery vs setting up an onchange event in the box as was my previously known method (jquery is much simpler!).
Further development could be made on checking to see if each variable i want to use is present before adding it to the table. currently the table returns an error if a variable is missing. 
I think the most time consuming part is properly parsing the return data, but starting simple was the key

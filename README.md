Describe the assignment
To create a website that pings an API upon a user interaction and then retrieves data and displays it on the site

Link to the hosted project, if not using localhost

Discuss what you chose to do and why
I chose to create "Song Vomit," a website where a user can search for any word and it will retrieve a song title with that word

Document any resources/research/inspiration
Two friends of mine know so many songs that they can find a song out of any word. Though I don't have that song knowledge, I figured I can do the same via programming. 

Explain your process
I created a simple interface where a user can search for a word, and retrieve the data

Highlight both successes and failures
I succeeded in creating a clean, modern website but the data is not displaying on my webpage. I need help figuring out why it will not work. I made the two changes that you told me to make but the data is still not displaying.














To disable Chrome's web secuirty flag (aka, the error you might get about Access Control Allowed Origin Header), close Chrome, open Terminal and paste this command 

```open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir```
